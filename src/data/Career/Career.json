        "answer":"Yes, we do hire from campuses and we believe firmly in grooming our own talent from schools. We hire people for not who they were; but more for who they could become. Hence, for that same reason we invest a good amount of our our time in curating our own talent from schools, that too not from the usual big name institutions (not that we don’t like them). But, from any place that is as anywhere it can get. School pedigree, doesn’t matter much to us."
