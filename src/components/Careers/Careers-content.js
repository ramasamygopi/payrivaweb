                <p>At purpleSlate, we are eternal optimists and we strongly believe the Future is as much about the exciting opportunities that lies ahead of us in leveraging technology to augment human capability, that helps solve some of the complex problems faced by the next billion. As machines become smarter, our abilities need to scale up the knowledge chain. It is no longer on WHAT you build but, as much about HOW you build software.</p>
