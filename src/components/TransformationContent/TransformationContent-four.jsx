                <p>Speed to value as a methodology for digital transformation is one of the least discussed topics in many forums. There will be the usual articles about other aspects of digital transformation such as setting the objective, getting leadership buy-in, change management, etc. Not that they’re not important, but the key aspect of any digital transformation project sits on recognizing value at the earliest.</p>

                <p>The core requirement is lost amidst the noise of setting expectations and other tasks. Speed to value breaks this usual clutter and focuses rigorously on ensuring the user gets value right from day-1 of the project where speed is of the ultimate essence.</p>
