                <p>A key methodology in addressing time delays is employing the speed-to-value methodology. Speed to Value is achieving maximum value by executing projects at speed in the shortest possible timeframe. The reasons are many, but we address the top 3 reasons for adopting Speed to Value.</p>

                    <li><b>Data-Driven World:</b> The spectrum of decision-making has gone through a 180-degree turn to depending on data for decision-making rather than relying on gut feelings. Thus, the faster the data is accessed, the better their decision-making. Digital transformation ensures better data collection at each point and a faster implementation will pave the way for enhanced data collection, decision-making, etc. </li>
                    <li><b>Diverse Users:</b> Digitally transforming a process or a part of a function, will impact the diverse set of users who will be working on the team. Their needs are different, and if the product or tool is down for extended periods of time, it will affect the effective functioning of the team.</li>
                    <li><b>Early Wins:</b> The greatest advantage speed to value possess over other digital transformation practices is assured early wins. Leaders can expect to see a positive impact in terms of breaking data silos, improved process efficiency, and effective interdepartmental collaboration. </li>
