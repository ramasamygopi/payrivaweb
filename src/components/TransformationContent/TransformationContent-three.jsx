                <p>Speed to value is a game changer for digital transformation projects. The project execution must ensure users derive the maximum value from their digital transformation effort. This can be achieved through a simple 4-point strategy. </p>

                <h2>S2V Committee </h2>

                <p>The S2V Committee or Speed to Value Committee is formed by members from both the product and the end-user side. This committee is set up to form the end objectives and governance policies and decide on which customizations need to go live. The S2V committee usually consists of members above the Associate VP level from the solution implementation team and of a similar cadre from the client. The team will also consist of a couple of end product users whose inputs will guide the committee further. The primary objectives of the S2V committee are two.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Project Health:</b> They will be tasked with monitoring the project’s health and understanding whether phase-wise implementation is happening within the timeline.</li>
                    <li><b>Finalizing Customizations:</b> Deciding on the final set of customizations and features that need to go live and putting the right interventions in place to ensure the project gets delivered within the accepted timelines.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Out-of-Box for Agility</h2>
            
                <p>The most common mistake people make with digital transformation projects are focusing on customizations instead of prioritizing out-of-box implementations. There are many benefits of implementing out-of-box in the preliminary stages instead of customizations. Out of box features are already tried and tested out in many different scenarios, and they definitely give an immediate advantage.</p>
                <div className="content-img">
                    <img src="https://www.purpleslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pic-4-1024x550.png" alt="" />
                </div>
                
                <p>The probability of an out-of-box functionality breaking while in production is minimal. Since it’s universal (many others also use the same functionalities), the support system will be robust. It also significantly cuts down the go-live time with customizations moving on to phase-2 of the project. The phase-1 is where out of box goes live and is focused on boosting maximum value.</p>

                <h2>Prioritizing Customizations </h2>
                
                <p>One factor to note is that there is no one size fits all approach to any digital transformation project. Every potential user expects some form of customization to match their business requirements. However, they all fail to prioritize customizations.</p>
                <p>The project’s second phase in speed to value is when customizations happen. This is also the phase where value stability, i.e. ensuring the value grows and scales, is given importance. Estimating which customization needs to go live, which can be parked, and which can be avoided altogether is essential. This is where the Complexity Significance Matrix comes into play.</p>
                <div className="content-img">
                    <img src="https://www.purpleslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MicrosoftTeams-image-36-1024x550.png" alt="" />
                </div>
                
                <p>The eponymous tool, Complexity Significance Matrix, helps the team decide on customizations based on the complexity of implementation and the significance of the customized element. They’re grouped into four sections, and the decision to implement the customization will be the decision of the S2V committee.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Must-Have:</b>Customizations that are low in complexity and high in significance get the highest priority. They will be immediately qualified for implementation as part of the second phase.</li>
                    <li><b>Can-Avoid:</b>Customizations that are low in complexity and low in significance are grouped as Can-Avoid. They are not on the priority list, and it’s the discretion of the committee to implement these or not.</li>
                    <li><b>Must-Avoid:</b> Customizations high in complexity and low in significance are classified as Must-Avoid. These customizations won’t add value in the long run and hence can be removed from the second phase of the implementation.</li>
                    <li><b>Good to Have:</b>Customizations that are high in complexity and high in significance take second precedence in the order of implementation. These customizations can also go live after implementing the customizations under the Must-Have section.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Finalizing the Right Partner</h2>
                <p>No one questions the role of an ally during a war. An ally is equally critical as the general, and the right partner for your digital transformation project can make or break the system. That’s why it’s essential to finalize a partner and not a vendor.</p>
                <p>Perform due diligence including in-depth assessments to understand the capabilities of the <a href="#">digital transformation services</a> partner. Analyze their technical capabilities, their understanding of technical requirements, and previous success in executing digital transformation projects.</p>
                <p>A simple three-step value definition process can be a starting point in finalizing the partner.</p>
                <div className="content-img">
                    <img src="https://www.purpleslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pic-6-1024x550.png" alt="" />
                </div>
                
                <p>Additionally, the following questions can help figure out the partner’s capabilities.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are their suggestions for digitally transforming the function or process?</li>
                    <li>How flexible is their pricing model and plan?</li>
                    <li>What additional support and services can one expect from them?</li>
                    <li>Is the new solution data source agnostic and scalable? </li>
                </ul>
